      After 10+ years working with CloudCannon across dozens of projects, these are the patterns that actually save time and reduce friction.
    features:
      - name: Automatic Schema Sync
        icon: "⚡"
        description: >-
          The scaffolding script reads your CloudCannon schemas and generates matching content-collections config. Change your schema once, run the script, and everything stays in sync. No more manual updates in multiple places.
      - name: Smart MDX Detection
        icon: "🎯"
        description: >-
          Automatically detects markdown fields in your CloudCannon config and compiles them to MDX. Content editors get rich formatting while developers get the power of React components in content.

    subtitle: Built for Speed
    content: >-
      This starter uses React 19 and Turbopack for lightning-fast hot reloading. The scaffolding scripts run automatically before dev and build commands, keeping your content collections and TypeScript types in sync without manual intervention. 


      Tailwind 4's fluid typography system means your text scales naturally across devices—no more managing breakpoints for every heading. The setup is opinionated but flexible: start building immediately, customize when you need to.
