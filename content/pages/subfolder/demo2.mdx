This is a demo page located in a subfolder to demonstrate nested routing.

Welcome to the second demo page! This page is located in `content/pages/subfolder/` to show how the routing system handles nested paths.

## Nested Routing

- Pages can be organized in subfolders
- URLs will reflect the folder structure
- This page should be accessible at `/subfolder/demo2`

## Content

You can add any content here using MDX syntax.

- Lists
- **Bold text**
- _Italic text_
- [Links](https://example.com)

Have fun with nested pages!
