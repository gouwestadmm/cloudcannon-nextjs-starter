title: Next.js Needs More Love (And I'm Here to Fix That)
summary: >-
  After 10 years of watching Jekyll get all the CloudCannon attention, I decided it was time Next.js had its moment in the spotlight. Here's a starter that makes CloudCannon + Next.js actually fun.

Look, I love Jekyll. I really do. But after 10 years of CloudCannon projects, I started to feel like Next.js was the middle child nobody talks about at family dinners. Sure, it's there, it works, but does anyone ever say "wow, look at Next.js go!"?

So I built a starter to fix that.

##### The Problem with Next.js + CloudCannon

Setting up Next.js with CloudCannon isn't hard—it's just... repetitive. Like, really repetitive. You write your CloudCannon schemas. Then you write your content-collections types. Then you realize you forgot to add a field. Then you update the schema. Then you update the types. Then you question your life choices.

It's like doing laundry—necessary, but nobody's excited about it.

##### What This Starter Actually Does

Think of it as a very helpful robot that reads your CloudCannon config and just... does the boring stuff for you:

- **Schemas → Types**: Write your CloudCannon schema once. The scaffolding script generates all the TypeScript types automatically.
- **Markdown → MDX**: Mark a field as markdown in CloudCannon. Boom, it's compiled to MDX with React component support. Editors type markdown, developers get components.
- **Blocks → Editable**: Create a new block component, register it, add it to the config. Visual editing just works.

The script runs automatically before dev and build. Change your schema, start the dev server, everything's in sync. No manual updates, no copy-paste, no forgetting to update things in three different places.

##### The Setup Takes Like 5 Minutes

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

That's it. Open `localhost:3000` and you've got:
- A working homepage with editable blocks
- Blog posts ready to go
- Visual editing that actually works
- Hot reload that doesn't make you wait

##### Real Talk: Why This Matters

I've built dozens of CloudCannon sites over the years. The setup phase always felt like a tax you pay before getting to the fun part. This starter skips that tax.

You get:
- **Content Collections** for fast HMR during development
- **React 19** because why not use the new stuff
- **Tailwind 4** with fluid typography that actually scales nicely
- **Turbopack** for builds that don't make you take a coffee break
- **Ultracite** (Biome) so you never think about formatting again

##### Try It Out

The whole thing is on GitHub, MIT licensed, ready to fork and customize. It's opinionated—I made choices so you don't have to—but it's flexible where it matters.

And hey, if you use it and build something cool, let me know. Next.js deserves more love, and I'm determined to make it happen one CloudCannon site at a time.

P.S. Jekyll folks, I still love you. You're like that reliable friend who always shows up on time. Next.js is just that other friend who brings snacks and knows how to fix your WiFi.
