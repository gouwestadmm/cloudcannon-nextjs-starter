I have been working with Cloudcannon for 10+ years ever since it was still in Beta (and yeah, I definitely used it in production back then). The last 5 years or so I have been switching over from Jekyll to Next.js, but kept utilizing CloudCannon for content management and visual editing for some of my projects. In this starter project I wanted to share some of my base setup patterns and best practices for building a Next.js site with CloudCannon. I hope this will help you get started faster with CloudCannon and Next.js, because it is a great combination!

##### Key Features

- **Cloudcannon base setup**: Pre-configured `cloudcannon.config.yml` with collections and schemas to get you started quickly.
- **Editable Regions**: Use CloudCannon's new editable regions visual editing to update content directly on the page. This starter includes a block based page-builder with some example blocks.
- **Content Collections**: Uses Content Collections to transform MDX content with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) during development for instant preview of content changes.
- **Auto-Scaffolding Script**: Automatically generates your content-collections configuration from CloudCannon config and schemas. It detects markdown fields and sets them up for automatic MDX compilation, creating both `field` and `field_mdx` properties—so editors use simple markdown while developers get React component support. This works recursively through nested objects and arrays too.
- **Next.js Routing**: Uses Next.js App Router with dynamic routing and `generateStaticParams` for static generation. Built with React 19 and Turbopack for faster development.
- **Tailwind 4 and Ultracite/Biome**: Tailwind 4 with fluid typography and custom theme system. Ultracite (Biome preset) handles formatting and linting with zero configuration.

##### Getting Started

To get started with this Next.js + CloudCannon starter, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have `pnpm` installed. Then, run the following command to install all dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Run the Development Server**:
   Start the development server to preview your site locally:

   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

   By default, the site will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

3. **Customize Your Content**:
   Modify `cloudcannon.config.yml` to define collections or update schemas in the `schemas/` directory. The scaffolding script runs automatically before dev and build commands, generating TypeScript types and content-collections configuration. It detects markdown fields from your CloudCannon config and sets them up for automatic MDX compilation.

4. **Add a New Block**:
   Create a block component in `src/components/blocks`, register it in `src/lib/component-registry.ts`, and add it to the `content_blocks` array in `cloudcannon.config.yml`.

5. **Deploy for CloudCannon Editing**:
   To enable CloudCannon editing, ensure the `ENVIRONMENT` environment variable is set to `cloudcannon` in your deployment configuration. For example, in Vercel, add this to your environment variables:

   ```bash
   ENVIRONMENT=cloudcannon
   ```

   This ensures that the Next.js configuration properly supports CloudCannon’s visual editing features.

By following these steps, you'll have a fully functional Next.js site integrated with CloudCannon, ready for content editing and further customization.

##### A Few Other Nice Touches

This starter uses some modern tools that make development more pleasant. It's built with React 19 and uses Turbopack for faster builds and hot reloading—especially noticeable when working with content.

Tailwind 4 is configured with a fluid typography system that scales smoothly across screen sizes, so text remains readable without manual breakpoint adjustments. The theme is defined in `src/app/globals.css` using CSS variables.

There's also a second scaffolding script (`generate-mdx-styles.js`) that extracts Tailwind classes from your components and generates matching styles for the CloudCannon editor. This keeps the editing experience visually consistent with your live site, which editors appreciate.

##### Key Files to Know

- `src/lib/component-registry.ts`: Register React components with CloudCannon's editable regions.
- `src/components/blocks`: Examples of reusable blocks with `Section` components for visual settings.
- `scripts/generate-content-collections.js`: Automates content configuration and TypeScript types.
- `cloudcannon.config.yml`: Define collections, schemas, and content blocks.

This starter is built to save time and reduce repetitive work. It provides a solid foundation for creating content-rich websites with modern tools.
